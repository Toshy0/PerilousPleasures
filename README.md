This is a very basic mod/application for Warhammer 40,000 Darktide that will read the user's peril level and send it to a Lovense / buttplugIO server. 

It requires you to be already using the "peril gauge" mod and have its threshold.lua file to transition from [0,0,0,0] to [0,255,0,0] - and that the peril gauge always be visible at a width of 200
At the moment, this only works with 1440p monitors due to the capture region being fixed in place (though I will soon be fixing this and just let the user select "4k - 1440 - 1080 - 720") 

To use this application, first open Intiface -> start the engine/server -> connect your toy -> Open the PerilousPleasures.exe -> the app should then guide you through the rest.


**If you ever need to pause or wish to manually set a vibration strength, you can  type and enter the number (0-100) into the console at any time**
